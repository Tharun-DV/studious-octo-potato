# Understanding Time Complexity: Big O Notation Explained

Time complexity is one of the most fundamental concepts in computer science. It helps us understand how algorithms perform as input size grows.

## What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity in the worst-case scenario.

```python
# O(1) - Constant time
def get_first_element(arr):
    return arr[0]

# O(n) - Linear time  
def find_element(arr, target):
    for element in arr:
        if element == target:
            return element
    return None

# O(n²) - Quadratic time
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

## Common Time Complexities

| Notation | Name | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| O(1) | Constant | Array access |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary search |
| O(n) | Linear | Linear search |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge sort |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Bubble sort |
| O(2ⁿ) | Exponential | Fibonacci (naive) |

## Practical Example: Binary Search

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

This algorithm runs in O(log n) time because we eliminate half the search space in each iteration.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Focus on growth rate** rather than exact operations
2. **Worst-case analysis** provides upper bounds
3. **Drop constants** and lower-order terms
4. **Consider space complexity** alongside time complexity

Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient code and solving algorithmic problems effectively.
